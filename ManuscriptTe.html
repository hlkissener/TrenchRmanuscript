<h1>APPENDIX S1</h1>
<p>We provide an additional example using microclimate data measured
along an elevation gradient in CO, USA to illustrate use of TrenchR. We
first use a time series of air temperatures and wind speeds collected at
multiple heights to examine profiles and surface roughness. We then use
a time series of air and surface temperatures, wind speeds, and solar
radiation collected at a single height to implement a biophysical model
for grasshoppers and compare estimates to observations. R markdown files
with the full code and the associated data are available at <a href="https://github.com/trenchproject/TrenchRmanuscript/" class="uri">https://github.com/trenchproject/TrenchRmanuscript/</a>.</p>

<h1>Microclimate Models</h1>
<p>We first examine how temperature and wind speed profiles can be used
to scale conditions to the heights of organisms. We start by using wind
speed variation across hours and heights to estimate surface
roughness.</p>

<p>We aggregate the data and plot average conditions across sites
(Figure S2). The simplifying assumptions in the biophysical model
implementation reduce alignment with the observed temperatures of
grasshoppers, but the divergence of grasshopper temperatures from air
temperatures at 2m and, to a lesser extent, air temperatures at
grasshopper height demonstrate the importance of implementing
biophysical models.</p>

<p><em>Figure S2. Diurnal temperature variation averaged across days in
August varies across the elevations of CO sites (panels) and the type of
temperature (C). Microclimate models indicate that the air temperatures
experienced by grasshoppers near the ground (Ta grasshopper height) is
generally above air temperatures (Ta) and close to surface temperatures
(Ts). Body temperatures estimated by a grasshopper specific biophysical
model (Te) are fairly similar to but sometimes less than the body
temperatures of a physical grasshopper model implanted with a thermistor
(Te observed). The general biophysical models that makes simplifying
assumptions (Te Gates) tends to overestimate body temperatures.</em></p>
